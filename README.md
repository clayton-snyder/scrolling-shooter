# scrolling-shooter
A simple side-to-side scrolling shooter game made with the Love2D game engine.

Shooting down an enemy ship grants (100 * multiplier) points. Multiplier starts at 1 is incremented by one for each ten accurate shots on enemies (up to 5). Missing a shot resets multiplier.

Main music by me

Power-up music is Elephant by Tame Impala
